##  Objective  
Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.

##  Tools  
- Online free password strength checkers (e.g., [Password Meter](https://passwordmeter.com/), [Password Monster](https://www.passwordmonster.com/))

## 1 Passwords by Complexity  

| Complexity Level     | Example Password           | Notes |
|----------------------|----------------------------|-------|
| Weak                 | `afif123`                  | Uses name + numbers (too easy to guess) |
| Fair                 | `Afif@2085`                | Mix of cases, symbol, number but predictable |
| Strong               | `Moinnnn#99`               | Good mix, but based on name |
| Very Strong          | `moi!7xQ2&kL`              | Randomized mix, no personal info |
| Extremely Strong     | `Cyber#Tiger_42RunsSlow!`  | Long, memorable passphrase |

## 3 Best Practices for Strong Passwords  
- ✅ Use at least **12–16 characters**.  
- ✅ Mix **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.  
- ✅ Avoid **personal info** (name, DOB, phone).  
- ✅ Don’t use **dictionary words or common patterns**.  
- ✅ Use **unique passwords** for each account.  
- ✅ Prefer **passphrases** (random words + symbols).  
- ✅ Store safely in a **password manager**.  
- ✅ Always enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.  

---

## 4 Tips Learned  
- Length = biggest strength factor.  
- Randomness defends against dictionary attacks.  
- Symbols & numbers slow brute force.  
- Passphrases = strong + memorable.  
- Avoid reusing passwords.  

---

## 5Common Password Attacks  
- **Brute Force:** Try all combinations.  
- **Dictionary Attack:** Use common wordlists.  
- **Credential Stuffing:** Reuse of leaked passwords.  
- **Phishing:** Trick users into revealing credentials.  
- **Keylogging:** Record keystrokes via malware.  
- **Shoulder Surfing:** Observe typing in public.  
- **Rainbow Table Attack:** Precomputed hash lookups.  
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Intercept credentials.  

---

## 6 Password Complexity & Security – Summary  
- **Length is Power** → More characters = exponential crack time.  
- **Character Variety** → Mixing symbols, cases, numbers strengthens security.  
- **Randomness Beats Patterns** → Avoid names, dates, and sequences.  
- **Passphrases Work Best** → Strong & memorable.  
- **Defense Against Attacks** → Strong passwords prevent brute force, dictionary, and credential-stuffing attacks.

##  Deliverables  
- ✅ Passwords with varying complexity.  
- ✅ Strength analysis results.  
- ✅ Best practices & lessons learned.  
- ✅ Explanation of common attacks.  
- ✅ Summary of password security principles.
