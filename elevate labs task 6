Name : Afif Moin 








1. Create Multiple Passwords with Varying Complexity


Passwords by Complexity
1. Weak → syed123

   * Uses your name + numbers (too easy to guess).

      2. Fair → Syed@2025

         * Mix of uppercase, symbol, and numbers, but still predictable.

            3. Strong → Mujahed#99

               * Upper/lowercase, special character, numbers, but still based on your name.

                  4. Very Strong → Ali!7xQ2&kL

                     * Randomized mix, not based on personal info.

                        5. Extremely Strong (Passphrase) → Cyber$Tiger_42RunsFast!

                           * Long, memorable passphrase with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

3.Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
                              1. Use at least 12–16 characters (longer = stronger).

                              2. Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

                              3. Avoid personal info (name, birthdate, phone number).

                              4. Don’t use dictionary words or common patterns (Password123, Qwerty@2025).

                              5. Use unique passwords for each account.

                              6. Prefer passphrases (random words + symbols) for both strength and memorability.

                              7. Store passwords securely in a password manager.

                              8. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) wherever possible.


4.Tips Learned from Evaluation
                                 * Length is the biggest factor → even simple words become hard to crack if very long.

                                 * Randomness protects against dictionary attacks.

                                 * Symbols and numbers slow down brute-force attacks.

                                 * Passphrases strike the best balance → easy to remember but very strong.

                                 * Avoid reusing passwords across accounts.

5.Common Password Attacks
                                    1. Brute Force Attack
 Try every possible character combination until the correct password is found. Long and complex passwords make this extremely slow.

                                    2. Dictionary Attack
 Uses a predefined list of common words and passwords. Any simple or word-based password is vulnerable.

                                    3. Credential Stuffing
 Hackers reuse leaked username-password pairs across multiple sites. Unique passwords prevent this.

                                    4. Phishing
 Tricks users into revealing passwords via fake emails, websites, or messages. User awareness and MFA help stop it.

                                    5. Keylogging
 Malware records keystrokes to steal passwords directly from the victim’s device. Anti-malware and cautious downloads defend against it.

                                    6. Shoulder Surfing
 Attackers watch you type your password in public. Awareness and password managers help reduce this risk.

                                    7. Rainbow Table Attack
 Uses precomputed hash values of common passwords to crack hashed databases quickly. Strong hashing and salts prevent it.

                                    8. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack
 Intercepts communications between user and server to capture login credentials. HTTPS, VPNs, and MFA provide protection.


6.Password Complexity & Security – Summary
                                       1. Length is Power → Longer passwords take exponentially more time to crack. A 6-character password may fall in seconds, but a 14+ character password can take centuries.

                                       2. Character Variety → Mixing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols increases the number of possible combinations, making brute-force attacks far harder.

                                       3. Randomness Beats Patterns → Predictable words, dates, or sequences are easy targets for dictionary attacks, while random or passphrase-based passwords resist them.

                                       4. Passphrases Work Best → Combining random words with numbers/symbols creates strong, memorable, and resilient passwords.

                                       5. Defense Against Attacks → Complex passwords drastically reduce the success of brute force, dictionary, and credential-stuffing attacks, improving overall account security.
